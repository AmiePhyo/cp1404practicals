Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was inconsistent at the beginning. Sometimes I underestimated tasks that involved unfamiliar concepts like file handling or GUI work.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As I gained more experience and became familiar with the types of tasks in the practicals, my time estimates became more accurate. I learned to break down tasks better and anticipate potential challenges.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that estimating time accurately requires reflection on past tasks and an honest assessment of my skill level. I also realized that overestimating can provide useful buffer time, while underestimating can lead to stress and rushed work.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned to accept feedback constructively and use it to improve the readability and structure of my code. Reviewers often pointed out things I had overlooked, such as unclear variable names or opportunities for simplifying logic.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others' code helped me understand different ways to solve the same problem. It also sharpened my attention to detail and improved my ability to spot logic errors and style inconsistencies.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[]()

### Explanation

In this review, I gave specific feedback on variable naming and suggested using a function to reduce duplication. I also encouraged the use of docstrings for clarity. The comments were constructive and backed with examples.

### Good Code Review 2

[]()

### Explanation

I complimented the code structure and provided a helpful suggestion for improving the logic in a conditional statement. I also mentioned how the solution could be made more efficient by using list comprehensions.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would include a few optional "challenge" tasks at the end of each practical for students who finish early and want to explore more advanced features. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I consistently followed the coding standards and wrote clear, maintainable code. I also made meaningful GitHub commits with descriptive messages and submitted code on time.
