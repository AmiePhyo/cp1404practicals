# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I have currently watched approximately 30% of the lecture videos.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I have scheduled one hour each night on campus to watch the lecture videos in a focused environment.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have found that writing code on paper has helped reinforce my understanding of programming logic, and I intend to continue this practice.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop relying on receiving answers during practical classes. Instead, I aim to become more proactive and independent when approaching coding problems.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I have a tendency to begin coding without carefully reading the questions or instructions. To improve, I will take the time to fully understand the task requirements.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

At this stage, I do not feel that I am performing particularly well in practicals.
