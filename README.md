# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## ABOUT

This repository contains my practical work for the subject CP1404 - Programming II at JamesCook University.

My name is Amie Phyo. I am learning Python through practical exercises focused on clean code, file handling, classes, and object-oriented programming.

## Lessons Learned

- I learned how important it is to use meaningful variable and function names so that the code is easy to understand later.
- I understand the value of separating logic into functions to follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
- I realized that consistently formatting and indenting my code makes it much easier to read and debug.
- I learned that writing docstrings for each function helps others (and future me) know what the function is doing.
- I now use enumerate instead of range(len(...)) when looping through lists, which makes my loops cleaner and more Pythonic.
